# Outlier-detection-using-DBSCAN-Clustering
Outliers are the abnormal or different from the rest of the values. This may be due to measurement error, manual error etc. These outliers affect the analysis and produce less accurate values.

Outlier detection and removal and handling missing values are the most important steps in data preprocessing.

DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm. Here the radius or the epsilon is set and the data points within this distance will be grouped together as a cluster. The data points outside the cluster will be considered as outliers.
